Sure! Here’s a **production-grade, top 0.1% checklist for DevOps projects**—structured, comprehensive, and aligned with industry-leading best practices covering infrastructure, security, automation, monitoring, compliance, and culture.

---

## 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Environment Setup

* [ ] Define infrastructure fully in IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation) with version control
* [ ] Use modular, reusable, and tested IaC components
* [ ] Implement environment segregation (dev, staging, prod) with strict isolation
* [ ] Containerize workloads (Docker), orchestrate with Kubernetes + Helm charts
* [ ] Validate Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts using tools (kube-score, kubeval)
* [ ] Use immutable infrastructure principles; no manual changes on prod
* [ ] Automate infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and rollback

---

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline & Automation

* [ ] Design pipelines for lint → build → test → security scans → deploy → post-deploy tests
* [ ] Automate builds, tests (unit, integration, E2E), and security scans (SAST, SCA, DAST)
* [ ] Implement automated container image scanning (Trivy, Clair)
* [ ] Manage secrets securely (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault) integrated into pipelines
* [ ] Implement automated rollback on failure
* [ ] Version and sign all artifacts and images
* [ ] Implement blue/green or canary deployments with traffic shifting and monitoring
* [ ] Use GitOps workflows (Flux, ArgoCD) for declarative deployments

---

## 3. Security & Compliance

* [ ] Enforce least privilege access controls (IAM, RBAC) across environments and tools
* [ ] Rotate secrets regularly and audit access logs
* [ ] Integrate SAST (CodeQL, SonarQube), SCA (Snyk, Dependabot), and DAST (OWASP ZAP) scans in pipeline
* [ ] Perform quarterly penetration testing and red team exercises
* [ ] Harden hosts: disable unnecessary services, enable auto patching, and enforce CIS benchmarks
* [ ] Implement network security (firewalls, WAF, IDS/IPS like Snort, Falco)
* [ ] Enforce multi-factor authentication and zero-trust principles
* [ ] Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit (TLS, disk encryption, KMS)
* [ ] Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, or other relevant standards
* [ ] Use logging and alerting to detect anomalous or suspicious activities

---

## 4. Monitoring, Observability & Incident Response

* [ ] Implement centralized logging (ELK, Splunk, Datadog) with structured logs
* [ ] Deploy distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) across services
* [ ] Monitor metrics (Prometheus, Grafana) for SLIs/SLOs, error rates, latency, resource usage
* [ ] Set up alerting with escalation policies to avoid alert fatigue
* [ ] Maintain incident response runbooks and playbooks
* [ ] Conduct regular incident drills and post-mortems
* [ ] Implement chaos engineering (Chaos Mesh, Gremlin) to validate resiliency
* [ ] Monitor and enforce service level agreements (SLAs) and objectives (SLOs)

---

## 5. Performance & Scalability

* [ ] Design auto-scaling policies for compute, storage, and network resources
* [ ] Optimize container images and startup times
* [ ] Use CDN for static content delivery and caching layers for dynamic content
* [ ] Monitor capacity and forecast demand for proactive scaling
* [ ] Implement circuit breakers, retries, and backpressure mechanisms

---

## 6. Backup, Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

* [ ] Implement automated backups for databases, config stores, and stateful services
* [ ] Regularly test restore processes and DR drills
* [ ] Implement multi-region and multi-AZ deployments for failover and resilience
* [ ] Maintain documented disaster recovery plans and runbooks
* [ ] Automate failover processes wherever possible

---

## 7. Documentation, Training & Culture

* [ ] Maintain comprehensive documentation: architecture, runbooks, playbooks, onboarding guides
* [ ] Conduct regular security and best-practice training sessions
* [ ] Enforce code and infrastructure reviews with quality and security gates
* [ ] Promote blameless postmortems and continuous improvement culture
* [ ] Establish on-call rotations and incident management protocols
* [ ] Regularly review and update compliance and governance policies
