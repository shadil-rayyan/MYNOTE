# ✅ AI Projects: Top 0.1% Production-Grade Checklist

---

## 1. Data Management

* [ ] Data sourcing: clean, diverse, and ethically collected datasets
* [ ] Data labeling quality control and validation
* [ ] Handle data privacy (GDPR, CCPA compliance) and anonymization
* [ ] Data versioning & lineage tracking (e.g., DVC, MLflow)
* [ ] Data augmentation & preprocessing pipelines automated
* [ ] Monitor data drift and concept drift in production

---

## 2. Model Development

* [ ] Define clear problem statement & success metrics
* [ ] Choose appropriate model architecture & baseline models
* [ ] Train models with reproducibility (seed control, environment capture)
* [ ] Hyperparameter tuning automation (e.g., Optuna, Hyperopt)
* [ ] Implement explainability and interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME)
* [ ] Incorporate fairness and bias evaluation and mitigation

---

## 3. Security & Privacy

* [ ] Secure sensitive data (encryption in transit & at rest)
* [ ] Protect models against adversarial attacks (adversarial training, robust evaluation)
* [ ] Secure APIs and model endpoints (authentication, rate-limiting)
* [ ] Audit and log model predictions and user interactions
* [ ] Implement differential privacy and federated learning if applicable

---

## 4. Testing & Validation

* [ ] Unit tests for data processing and model components
* [ ] Model validation on holdout and real-world datasets
* [ ] Perform A/B testing and shadow testing in production
* [ ] Monitor model performance degradation and trigger retraining
* [ ] Bias and fairness testing with representative datasets
* [ ] Performance and scalability testing under realistic workloads

---

## 5. Deployment & Infrastructure

* [ ] Containerize models with Docker and orchestrate with Kubernetes
* [ ] Use scalable serving frameworks (TF Serving, TorchServe, KFServing)
* [ ] CI/CD pipelines for automated retraining, testing, and deployment
* [ ] Implement model versioning and rollback capabilities
* [ ] Real-time monitoring of latency, throughput, and errors
* [ ] Autoscaling and resource management for cost-efficiency

---

## 6. Observability & Monitoring

* [ ] Track model predictions, inputs, and outputs with logging
* [ ] Alerting on model drift, performance degradation, and failures
* [ ] Use dashboards for real-time model health and data quality monitoring
* [ ] Collect user feedback and integrate into model improvement loop

---

## 7. Ethics & Compliance

* [ ] Implement ethical AI guidelines and governance policies
* [ ] Transparency: document datasets, model design, limitations (Model Cards, Datasheets)
* [ ] Ensure compliance with local and international AI regulations
* [ ] User consent and opt-out mechanisms for AI-driven features
* [ ] Regular audits and third-party reviews of AI systems

---

## 8. Documentation & Collaboration

* [ ] Maintain comprehensive model documentation and data catalog
* [ ] Document training experiments, hyperparameters, and evaluation results
* [ ] Share notebooks, code, and datasets via version-controlled repos
* [ ] Cross-team collaboration workflows between data scientists, engineers, and product teams

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement

* [ ] Automate retraining pipelines triggered by data drift or new data
* [ ] Use feedback loops to refine model performance continuously
* [ ] Conduct regular post-mortems on model failures and incidents
* [ ] Keep up with state-of-the-art research and integrate improvements
