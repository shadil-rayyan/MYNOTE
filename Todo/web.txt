* [ ] Disaster recovery plan and post-mortem workflows
* [ ] Disaster recovery + incident runbooks

---

## 5. Monitoring & Observability

* [ ] Structured logs + tracing + SLO alerting + runbooks
* [ ] Observability: structured logs, tracing, health-checks, alert fatigue management
* [ ] Paging & SLO-based alerts with runbooks
* [ ] Centralized logging, tracing, alerts
